title: About me
---

I am a PhD. candidate in Physics at the Wrocław University of Science and Technology (Department of Theoretical Physics). Currently in my research I am focusing on the DMRG algorithm in the MPS formalism. Further, I would like to apply PEPS and (in general) Tensor Networks in such areas as Quantum Computing and Machine Learning. 


### My scientific interests:
- Quantum computation and quantum information.
- Solid state physics.
- Quantum measurement.
